A simple 'I like this' plugin inspired by the facebook 'like' functionality.

== Description ==
A simple 'I like this' plugin inspired by the facebook 'like' functionality.  For visitors who don't want to bother with commenting.
http://lifeasrose.ca/2011/03/wordpress-plugin-i-like-this
has a blog entry all about it :)

A big thanks to Dong (ddliuhb@gmail.com) for finding a syntactical error that was causing problems for some people.  And thanks to Raphael (ressoosnowdon@googlemail.com) for noticing this error and working hard to figure out what it was.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the files into a folder named `roses-like-this` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php printLikes(get_the_ID()); ?>` in 'the loop' of your posts wherever you want the 'like this' link to appear.


IMPORTANT!!!!
PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR THEME HAS THE FOLLOWING LINE IN ITS HEADER FILE:
`<?php wp_print_scripts(); ?>`

...Most high quality themes should have this already but if you're writing your own theme or using a custom theme that doesn't include this line, please make sure you include it in header.php, somewhere between `<head>` and `</head>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I make the 'like this' link look prettier? =

With CSS :) Here is the code that I use:
`a.done {
background:url("http://yoururl.com/wordpress/plugins/roses-like-this/action_check.png") bottom right no-repeat;
padding-right:18px;
color:#8bcb46;
}`

= The javascript is not working! =

`<?php wp_print_scripts(); ?>`

= The javascript is STILL not working!!! =
Do you call get_header() in your theme?  This is also needed, although almost certainly there anyway.

= The javascript is STILL not working AGAIN!!! =
The plugin expects to find the javascript file in a folder called `roses-like-this` under /plugins.  So if you have named the folder something else, you're probably getting a 404 error!

To fix, you can either rename your folder `roses-like-this`  OR you can edit the `likethis.php` file and edit line `112` roses-like-this/ to yourfoldername/

== Changelog ==

* The very first version of this plugin :)
