== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How To Add A Polls Archive? =
1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Pages -> Add New`.
2. Type any title you like in the post's title area.
3. If you ARE  using nice permalinks,  after typing the title, WordPress will generate the permalink to the page. You will see an 'Edit' link just beside the permalink.
4. Click 'Edit' and type in `pollsarchive` in the text field and click 'Save'.
5. Type `[page_polls]` in the post's content area.
6. Click 'Publish'.

* If you ARE NOT using nice permalinks, you need to go to `WP-Admin -> Polls -> Poll Options` and under `Poll Archive -> Polls Archive URL`, you need to fill in the URL to the Polls Archive Page you created above.

= How Does WP-Polls Load CSS? =
* WP-Polls will load 'polls-css.css' from your theme's directory if it exists.
* If it doesn't exists, it will just load the default 'polls-css.css' that comes with WP-Polls.
* This will allow you to upgrade WP-Polls without worrying about overwriting your polls styles that you have created.

= Why In Internet Explorer (IE) The poll's Text Appear Jagged? =
* To solve this issue, Open poll-css.css
* Find: `/* background-color: #ffffff; */`
* Replace: `background-color: #ffffff;` (where #ffffff should be your background color for the poll.)

= How Do I Have Individual Colors For Each Poll's Bar? =
* Courtesy Of [TreedBox.com](http://treedbox.com "TreedBox.com")
* Open poll-css.css
* Add to the end of the file:
