With this plugin, you may plan the backup of your entire website (folders, files and/or database).

== Description ==

With this plugin, you may plan the backup of your entire website (folders, files and/or database).

You can choose:

* which folders you want to save;
* the frequency of the backup process;
* whether your database should be saved;
* whether the backup is stored on the local website, sent by email or stored on a distant FTP (support of multipart zip files)

This plugin is under GPL licence

= Multisite - Wordpress MU =

This plugin is compatible with Multisite installation.

Each blog administrator may save their own data.

The super-admin may save either its data or the whole website. By saving the whole site, the admin may create different SQL files for the subsite in order to ease the restoration of a single sub-site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Forced backup never ends (but there is no displayed error) =

Be sure to stay on the configuration page : if you quit the page, the forced backup process will be killed !

= Scheduled backup is stucked =

Scheduled backup only works on website that have traffic.

Indeed, each visits triggers a piece of the backup process.

Thus, if there is no traffic, the schedule backup process wont't occur. If there is very little traffic, the backup will be very long, etc

= I have an error message indicating that another backup is running =

This message may happen if the chunk size is set quite high. For instance, 40 Mo is clearly too big and server  server configuration of many webhosters will kill scripts which use too much memory.

Most of the case 5Mo is ok.

If you get this error, set the chunk size to 1Mo and if it solves your problem, increase this chunk size.

= Compatible Archive Software =

The backup will be in a multi-part format. In order to uncompress it, you should put all the backup in the same folder and open the .zip file with Winzip.

You may experience some "corruption" error. It is mainly due that archive software are not compatible with multi-part archives. I have tried with success:

* Winzip (version 16.0 tested),
* WinRar (some issue with UTF8 characters), and
* IZArc (some issue with UTF8 characters).

= NOT-Compatible Archive Software =

These software are *not* compatible with multi-part archives:

* 7-zip, and
* the Windows Explorer embedded function.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you face some issues.

= To restore the backups =

* install a fresh version of Wordpress on your server ;
* unzip the backup (actually, the zip file comprises a plurality of files i.e. a multi-part zip (zip, z01, z02, etc.). These files should be saved in a same folder and your zip program (such as IZArc, Winzip, Winrar, ...) will do the job for you...
* If you have configured to save the entire installation, replace all the wordpress files by the one in the zip file and import the SQL files (at the root of the zip file, the files named *.sql1, *sql2, etc.) in your database (with for instance phpmyadmin). It is recommended to save your database first ;
* In other cases, replace the 'plugins',  'themes', 'uploads' folders (in the wp-content folder) with the one in the archive, replace the wp-config.php (at the root of your wordpress repository) with the one at the root of the zip file and  import the SQL files (at the root of the zip file, the files named *.sql1, *sql2, etc.) in your database (with for instance phpmyadmin). It is recommended to save your database first.

= The backup files are corrupted =

Be sure that all thz zip files (i.e. .zip, .z01, z02, etc.) are in the same folder.
If you have still this issue, please try with Winzip software.
