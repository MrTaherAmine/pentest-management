# INSTALL

WPScan comes pre-installed on the following Linux distributions:

- [BackBox Linux](http://www.backbox.org/)
- [Kali Linux](http://www.kali.org/)
- [Pentoo](http://www.pentoo.ch/)
- [SamuraiWTF](http://samurai.inguardians.com/)
- [BlackArch](http://blackarch.org/)

On macOS WPScan is packaged by [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as [`wpscan`](http://braumeister.org/formula/wpscan).

Windows is not supported

We suggest you use our official Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/wpscanteam/wpscan/ to avoid installation problems.

# DOCKER
## Install Docker
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## Get the image
Pull the repo with `docker pull wpscanteam/wpscan`

## Start WPScan

```
docker run -it --rm wpscanteam/wpscan -u https://yourblog.com [options]
```

For the available Options, please see https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan#wpscan-arguments

If you run the git version of wpscan we included some binstubs in ./bin for easier start of wpscan.

## Examples

Mount a local wordlist to the docker container and start a bruteforce attack for user admin

```
docker run -it --rm -v ~/wordlists:/wordlists wpscanteam/wpscan --url https://yourblog.com --wordlist /wordlists/crackstation.txt --username admin
```

(This mounts the host directory `~/wordlists` to the container in the path `/wordlists`)

Use logfile option
```
# the file must exist prior to starting the container, otherwise docker will create a directory with the filename
touch ~/FILENAME
docker run -it --rm -v ~/FILENAME:/wpscan/output.txt wpscanteam/wpscan --url https://yourblog.com --log /wpscan/output.txt
```
